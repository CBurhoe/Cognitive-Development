two main brain types (greenberg et al., 2023)
- >460,000 participants
- eyes test in English in 57 countries
- eyes test translated in 16 countries
- "reading the mind in the eyes" test
- F vs M
	- across lifespan (different ages, not longitudinal)
	- across different countries/cultures
results
	- F advantage across lifespan
		- performance peaks for both around 21 years, slowly deteriorates afterward
	- F advantage across countries
		- 36/57 significant
		- 0/57 M>F

extreme male brain theory of autism
- autism- abnormal social development, communication, and display of unusually strong interests
- predominantly in males (high functioning autism (...))

evidence- ASD relative weaknesses
- theory of mind tasks (normal girls better than boys; autistic children even worse than normal boys)
- reading the mind in the eyes (discriminating emotion from eye expressions; girls better than boys, AS people lower than males)
- eye contact: females make more eye contact than males, people with autism make less eye contact than normal males
- language dev: boys slower than girls for vocab; autistic children even slower
- faux pas test: females better than males; people with autism poorer than neurotypical males
ASD relative strengths
- islets of ability (savant skills and abilities)
- attention to detail (storng on embedded figures tasks)
- tests of intuitive physics (males better than females; AS people better than males)
- toy preference - very strong for vehicles
- obsessive collecting

EMB theory of autism
- greenberg et al., 2018
- >670000 people including 36,648 autistic
- empathy, systemizing, autism spectrum, sensory perception quotients



perception and action

perception - senses; vision, audition, etc


perception, action, development
- problem: correspondence between 2D sensations and perception of 3D world. how rich is the baby's mental world?
- broad theoretical frameworks
	- nativists (kant; descartes)
		- babies should know how to translate 2D impressions to 3D world because it's innate
	- empiricists (locke; berkeley; hume)
		- babies don't know anything because lack experience
- addressing these
	- basic discrimination present
	- perceptual categories (phonemes)
	- perceiving a 3D world: objects of constant size
	- imitation
	- visuo-motor action coordination
	- faces: a special case?

2D sensation; 3D perception
- e.g., olfaction
	- nasal membranes register chemical molecules from source; source diffuses molceules in all directions; sense receptors spread evenly throughout nose receive impact
	- but: blindfolded person can tell the direction of odor's source
	- solution: differential intensity of stimulation, depends on time of receipt (von Bekesy, 1969)
- e.g., vision
	- light enters lens, projected onto retina
	- inverse projection problem
	- proximal and distal stimuli
some examples
- taste (grimaces, smiles)
- localization: newborn turns eyes to direction of sound (wertheimer, 1961)
- auditory (one's own mother; DeCasper & Fifer, 1980)
- shape discrimination

discriminating tastes
- can newborns distinguish between different basic tastes
- apparently so, from these differences in facial expressions to neutral, sweet, sour, and bitter

auditory discrimination and its use in early learning (decasper & fifer, 1980, Science)
- measure sucking rate while listening to different sitmuli
- can newborns learn a task that brings on mother's voice
- components
	- discrimination of mother's voice from stranger's voice
	- ability to learn
	- control of own responses (in this case, sucking)
- condition 1: long interval between sucking burst- mother's voice; short interval- other's voice; then test
- condition 2: reverse; then test
- results
	- 8/10 infants produce sucking pattern that will bring on own mother's voice
	- infants can distinguish their own mother's voice from that of another mother and use it to learn

basic visual acuity
- newborns are very nearsighted (20/300-20/600)
- acuity improves dramatically over the first few months, with near mature acuity by 4 months
- visual scanning patterns
	- as age increases, field of scanning increases, and length of fixation on a single point decreases
	- i.e. more scanning activity

habituation/dishabituation
- babies can be tested on their perception by allowing them to suck on a pacifier connected to recording instruments while stimuli presented
(...)

shape discrimination
- fantz's original "looking chamber" designed to test visual interests of newborns
- infants looking itme to different stimuli measured and compared
- during first weeks of life, infants prefer patterned to plain stimuli
- faces appear to be particularly interesting
