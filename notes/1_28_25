methods of study
- naturalistic
	- diary studies
- clinical
	- interviews
- experimental
	- experimental and control groups
	- designs: longitudinal, cross-sectional
- problem: correlation and causation
	- e.g.: IQ and grades in school (causality?)

research design
- longitudinal
	- same subjects across different ages as they grow
- cross-sectional
	- different subjects of different ages at a single point in time
- cohort sequential
	- combines longitudinal and cross-sectional
	- multiple cohorts at multiple points in time
- microgenetic
	- different subjects at the same age, looking at a specific effect/milestone/development/stage

experimental method e.g.:
- Q: can "kangaroo care" facilitate development in low birth-weight babies?
- "kangaroo babies" experiment in Colombia (Charpak et al., 2001)
- motivation: low birth-weight babies do not thrive as well (failure to thrive), slower at gaining weight than babies born at normal weight
	- 7lbs, 3.5kg average birth weight
	- 5lbs, 2.5kg considered low birth weight
- kangaroo care: keeping baby in contact with skin (mom, dad, stranger, doesn't matter)
- randomized controlled trial
- experimental group: kangaroo treatment
- control group: incubator treatment
results
- more regular breathing, quicker mastery of breast-feeding in kangaroo group; longer term, faster achievement of developmental milestones
- major acute effects; less drastic but still significant chronic effects
- example of a longitudinal experiment (tracking developmental milestones)



genes, environment, and cognition:

prenatal development
- count pregnancy length by cycles
	- pregnancy length begins at the first day of the previous cycle before conception (usually conception + 2 weeks)
	- full term is 40 weeks (37 weeks or later still considered full term)
- conception begins at formation of a zygot
- germinal period
	- conception to implantation of blastocyst in uterous (7-10 days)
- embryonic period
	- implantation to early organs (8th week)
- fetal period
	- 9th week to birth

germinal period
- conception to implantation (6-10 days)
- zygote
	- fusion of egg & sperm during conception
	- single cell with 23 pairs of chromosomes (half from egg, half from sperm)
	- foundation for all cells that develop in an individual
- each cycle, ovaries alternate releasing egg
- egg released into falopian tube
- sperm meets egg in falopian tube, fertilizes egg
- first cleavage, cell divides into two
- morula is a clump of cells, leaves fallopian tube
- blastocyst implants in side of uterus

germinal period: twins
- monozygotic (identical twins)
	- single sperm, single egg
	- at some point, zygote splits into different clumps
	- 0.3% of deliveries
	- uniform across the world
	- not genetic
	- cause unknown

	- if cleavage at morula stage
		- dichorionic/diamniotic (two placentas, two fluid sacks)

	- if cleavage later at blastocyst stage
		- monochorionic, diamniotic

	- if cleavage after implantation
		- monochorionic, monoamniotic (fairly dangerous because of umbilical cord tangling)

	- if cleavage later after formed embryonic disc
		- conjoined twins

- dizygotic
