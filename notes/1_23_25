first studies

darwin's diary studies (19th-20th century)
- ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny?
	- development of one organism repeats the development of the entire species
	- ontogeny: development of an individual
	- phylogeny: development of species through evolution
- developmental milestones
	- first words and walking by first birthday

20th century science: experimentation
- behaviorists: nurture
	- skinner; watson & rayner and "little albert"
	- albert was classically conditioned by watson
	- watson presented albert with objects albert liked such as fire, a monkey, a dog, a rabbit, and a white rat
	- when albert reached for an object (the rat) a bar was struck to make a sharp noise to evoke a fear response
	- upon presenting albert with a rabbit and a dog, albert began crying and tried to move away from it
	- generalization: reacting to different objects with similar characteristics as a conditioned stimulus
	- 1 month followup: demonstrated same fear responses
	- watson's conclusion: phobias are a result of nurture
- ecologists: nature and niche
	- lorenz
	- animal behaviors
- cognitive developmentalist: nature, nurture, and interactions
	- piaget; spelke
	- piaget studied own kids
	- outlined stages of development
	- experiments with groups of children
	- same stages of development used today in categorizing and assessing child development
	- piaget was a nativist/rationalist: believes in biological endowment; not born as a blank slate
- language: nature
	- chomsky
	- born with language module in our brains; language is innate
	- can learn language even with impoverished/limited input
- language: behaviorists
	- language is a conditioned response
	- deprived of input, language will not develop
- testing: practical matters
	- bayley
	- bayley scales: from birth to several years old, not for older kids
	- physical development
	- related to APGAR
- mental illness: the psyche
	- freud; later, genetics


sources of development: nature and nurture
- genes: dna sequences, on chromosomes
- environment/experience
	- e.g., temperature, cellular, linguistic, etc.
- genes and environmnet interact
	- himmalayan rabbit experiment
	- genes dictate that parts of rabbit farther from center of mass/heat source are dark, body is white
	- strap ice pack to rabbit for several weeks
	- upon removal, area with ice pack producing dark fur

- what does experience do
	- maintenance
		- serves to maintain some aspect of development that is already present
		- e.g. spontaneous motion of chick embryos
	- facilitation
		- aids/facilitates some aspect of development
		- e.g. blind childran are late to walk
	- induction
		- during narrow timeframe, closely channels development
		- e.g. imprinting; language learning

mechanism: continuity vs discontinuity
- human development: mix of each
	- skill development probably discontinuous
	- physical development probably continuous

learning and plasticity: critical/sensitive periods
- human examples
	- language learning
	- sexual differentiation

species specificity
- what aspects of cognition are uniquely human
- what aspects are shared across species
	- number?
	- language?

some appealing but overly simplistic notions
- ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny
	- counterexample: teeth evolved before tongues, but mammalian tongues develop before teeth
- development is determined by genes OR experience (nature vs nurture)
	- counterexample: phenylketonuria (PKU) a genetic defect that is remediable by diet
- development is maturational OR experiential
	- counterexample: walking normally emerges on time, but can be accelerated

previously... some examples
- darwins studies; piaget observations
- skinners box, informal experiments
- testing adapted from animals e.g. watson and raynors experiment - previous pavlov and conditioning in dogs

newer experimental methods


methods of study
- naturalistic
