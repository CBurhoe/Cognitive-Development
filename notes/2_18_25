Last time: masculinized female rats and feminized male rats
- different outcomes based on when hormones introduced

for many behaviors, T generates male patterns; absence of T generates female patterns
e.g. zebra finches and canaries
- vocal organ connected to nuclei in brain
- nuclei (of both species) accumulate testosterone; these and related regions 5-6 times larger in males than in females
- i.e. presence of T makes them grow larger
- lesioning disrupts singing in adult males
- size of region is susceptible to adult steroids
	- castration of M canaries -> reduced size of nuclei
	- F given T -> regions become as large as in M (finch) or enlarge (canary)
	- critical period: but adult females still don't sing like males, unless exposed to T early in development, shortly after hatching
	- males also susceptible to critical period: if males don't learn to sing during critical period, they will not be able to sing at all

data from human clinical cases provide evidence that:
- F form develops unless T intervenes
- presence of T causes masculinization

evidence for point 1: F form develops unless T intervenes
- Turner's syndrome: 45XO
	- no SRY gene
- no gonadal tissue forms
- typically occurs in phenotypic F who doesn't change into mature F at puberty due to lack of gonads
- genotypically neither F nor M, just XO. underdeveloped ovaries and very low levels of both M and F hormones
- poor spatial and numerical abilities
- POINT: anhormonal condition results in F phenotype, socially and morphologically
	- if treated in adolescence with estrogen/progesterone, develops morphologic features (but sterile)

more evidence for point 1: F form develops unless T intervenes
- androgen-insensitivity syndrome
	- X-linked recessive defect
	- females with two defective X chromosomes, or males with defective X chromosome
- symptoms: during fetal development, testes produce appropriate M hormones, but tissues (receptors) are insensitive to these hormones
	- development therefore proceeds as if no M hormones
- results: looks like phenotypic F, usually raised as girls; have female orientation
- adolescence: normally secreted estrogens yield adult morphological changes to externals
- genetic M (XY) can develop as phenotypic F

evidence for point 2: presence of T causes masculinization
- congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)
- proliferation of cells surrounding adrenals
- genetic X-linked recessive disorder
- adrenal glands produce abrnormally high amounts of androgen beginning in 3rd month post-conception
- if XX- exposure to too much androgen; if XY- exposure to more than normal androgen
- results: XX develops with male or partly male genitalia
- treatment with cortisone for life to control androgen levels
- organizational effects on structure; possibly also on behavior (evidence from studies of aggression, play, spatial abilities)

sexual differentiation: body brain and mind
- sexual dimorphism- differences in physical and/or behavioral, organizational, cognitive functions
- e.g.
	- sexual displays by rats (lordosis vs mounting)
	- zebra finch birdsongs (males sing; females don't)
	- maternal behavior in rodents
	- urination patterns for dogs
	- aggression
	- visuo spatial differences

early observations: rough and tumble play
- rhesus monkeys
- males much more rough and tumble play than females

anatomical sexual dimorphisms in human nervous system (zup & forger, 2002)
- body structure, size, muscle mass, etc.
- overall brain size larger in M (even when corrected for body size)
- also more neurons in M neocortex than F (but unknown whether there is also difference in neuronal density)
- some evidence for more synapses in F
- larger planum temporale in F (language?)
- corpus callosum (posterior) may be larger in F (and language is less lateralized in F) (?)
- hypothalamus: INAH-3 larger in M (located in region controlling male sexual behavior in vertebrates)
- neurotransmitter levels: rate of synthesis of seretonin higher in M than F (PET evidence)
- and M have higher number of binding sites for serotonin (higher sensitivity?) (PET evidence)
- serotonin popularly believed to be a contributor for feelings of well-being and happiness
- diff in serotonin levels have implications for mental health (missed the end of this?)


role of hormones ion dimorphic organization of brain
- mammals: female cyclicity; male non-cyclicity
- F mammals: pituitary releases FSH, ovary produces estrogen; estrogen surge acts on hypothalamus to inhibit further FSH, and stimulate production of LH; LH triggers ovulation and amkes ovary produce progesteronel progesterone reaches hypothalamus and inhibits further LH; start again
- male mammals: pituitary continually releases ICSH; this makes testes produce testosterone; this acts on hypothalamus to stimulate further release of ICSH by pituitary

what about human cognition?
- neurological and psychiatric disorders (zup and forger, 2002)
- males: more ADHD, autism, dyslexia, stuttering, sleep disorders (more)
- females: missed this

- language (vs visuospatial and math) e.g.
	- brain activation during phonological (rhyming decision) task: M use left hemisphere, F less lateralized (fMRI studies)
	- brain activation during grammatical task: F less lateralized than M (who use left hemisphere) (PET study)

human cognition
- data vs interpetation of data
- what protion of distribution are you using
- what group are you studying
- which measurements/test are you using
- effect sizes
	- large if mean difference (cohen's d) between groups is >0.8 of S.D. scores
	- medium if 0.5
	- small if <=0.2
- cohen's d = ((mean in males) - (mean in females)) / (standard deviation of males & females)
	- positive = males > females
	- negative = females > males


effect sizes
- aggression - moderate
- 3D visual rotation - large
- 2D visual rotation - small
- spatial perception - small-moderate
- spatial visualization - negligible
- overall quantitative - small-moderate
- overall verbal - negligible-small
- verbal-assn fluency - moderate

historically, evidence overall: males tend to be superior to females in spatial cognition
- some intriguing evidence from rats as well
