last time: 
- experience counts; moving around the world changes predicitons about effects

effects of learning to crawl
- experience -> fear of heights -> avoidance
- reflects understanding of what kinds of ground properties needed to support body
- experiential, general learning - once you've learned about the correlation, it carries across to all motor patterns

alternative: sway model (karen adolph)
- falling due to insufficient muscle strength needed to pull oneself back into position
- varies with surface properties and with action- sit, crawl, walk posture have different regions of "permissible sway"
- infant must adjust to avoid moving towards outer limits- need to gauge own muscle torque relative to sway

adolph's argument: fear is not a component in this phenomenon
- 4 learning curves through development: sitting, crawling, cruising, walking
- if they had a fear of heights, then there should not be multiple learnings curves
- more likely to be just a consequence of infants learning to move in a coordinated fashion and preserve stability
- proposal: organized within each postural system; learning is posture specific
- possible evidence: test generalization of knowledge that the body cannot be supported in an empty space (...)

variation across motor systems: adolph's experiments
- 9-month olds tested in experienced sitting posture and less familiar crawling posture within same session
- with increasing gap distance between baby and stick:
  - sit and reach for toy at end of stick
  - crawl to reach for toy on platform
- psychophysical staircase procedure until 67% criterion for each infant
- then test with safe to increasingly risky gaps
results
- infants avoid risky gaps more often when sitting than when crawling
- appear to be testing their own sway by makign exploratory arm extensions even for risky gaps, then retracting their arms to regain balance

reckless crawlers:
- group of babies that would crawl even when the gap was very risky
- probability of falling is much higher than the probability of avoiding while crawling for this group of babies
- furthermore, no evidence of learning from their falls; after failures, 88% of trials were attempted anew by the babies

Q: did babies avoid risky gap while sitting simply because the landing platform was always the same distance?
- revised trial: landing platform now at same distance as toy
- same results

inferrences
- posture-specific findings argue against general knowledge such as fear of heights (...)
- but transfer does occur. it is subtle
- within-postures, infants show generalization of learning
- longitudinal slopes study: each week, infants tested on ability to go down safe/risky slope; 
  as body and skills changed, biomechanics of balance changed. over change, infants continually improve
- sway model: infants learn posture by posture, how to discover online, the permissible boundaries of sway for different postures.




face perception
Q: are newborns equipped with a face-specific processing mechanism OR are newborns face-preferences a result of general perceptual processing biases?

~4 weeks: baby drawn to image of contrast which mirrors the areas of constrast in a face
~8 weeks: baby drawn to image mimicking a face (not just contrast)


face specific processing?
- automatic: want evidence that faces are processed rapidly and as a whole
- stereotyped: input to face processing should be very specific, and results in specific computations
- encapsulated (or impenetrable): we cannot help but to see a face as a face, other properties do not interfere with the perception of faces
- over early development: critical period effects? perceptual narrowinf with experience? improvement with experience?

face perception in face-deprived monkeys (sugita, 2008)
- infant monkeys reared with no exposure to faces
- test during face deprivation
- test after 1 month of exposure to human OR monkey faces
- test after 1 year of exposure to human AND monkey faces

task 1: preferential looking: longer looking times at preferred image
task 2: visual paired comparison: longer looking times at novel objects

PL results:
- control: monkeys > humans = objects
- infants deprived, no exposure: humans = monkeys > objects
- human exposure 1 month: humans > monkeys = objects
- human exposure 1 year: humans > monkeys = objects
- monkey exposure 1 month: monkeys > humans = objects
- monkey exposure 1 year: monkeys > humans = objects

VPC results:
- X: humans; monkeys

- control: bad; good
- infant deprived: good; good
- human exposure 1 month: good; bad
- human exposure 1 year: good; bad
- monkey exposure 1 month: bad; good
- monkey exposure 1 year: bad; good

we know that
- newborns show a preference for face-like stimuli (fantz, 1963)
- why?

spectrum of explanations:
- prewired for processing
- prewired for orienting towards- biases
- preference for general structural properties


why faces are not special to newborns (turati, 2004)
- general structural properties present in faces as well as other objects in the world
- up-down symmetry: presence of more elements in the upper vs lower portions(?...)
- congruency: relation between inner configuration of elements and outer contour- most elements in the widest part of the shape
