Recap: In the normal case, newborn is a hearing, seeing, perceiving, thinking being

influences in prenatal development
- maternal attitudes and stress
- nutrition
- teratogens
	- drugs (caffeine, alcohol, tobacco, narcotics)
	- infections
	- Rh incompatibility
		- Rhesus protein (+ or - in blood type)
		- if mother is - but dad is +, baby could inherit + from dad
		- presents a possibility for reaction in mother during delivery when blood could mix
		- usually only an issue for multiple pregnancies
	- Radiation
	- Pollution

earlier in development, teratogens have more possibility and severity of effect
- germinal period: prenatal death
- embryonic period: major structural abnormalities
- fetal period: physiological defects and minor structural abnormalities
- dependant on which structures are in early development during introduction of teratogens



genes

cell contains nucleus, nucleus contains chromosomes, chromosomes contain coiled DNA, DNA contains gene encodings

chromosome - single piece of coiled DNA containing many genes
gene - portion of a DNA in a chromosome

cell division
- somatic cells (body cells, non-reproductive) contain 46 chromosomes in 23 pairs
	- 22 pairs
	- 23rd pair is XX or XY
	- half of a chromosome is a chromatid
	- telomere is the end of chromosome
	- centromere is the center of chromosome
- germ cells (sperm and ova) contain 23 unpaired chromosomes

mitosis
- process of making new somatic cells
- cyclic process
1. chromosomes replicate, producing an identical copy of each
2. identical chromosomes separate, cell divides
3. new cells chromosomes are identical to the original cell

meiosis
- process of making new germ cells
- non-cyclic process
crossover - homologous recombination
	- seeds genetic diversity
1. interphase
2. homologous chromosomes
3. meiosis 1
4. daughter nuclei
5. meiosis 2
6. daughter nuclei 2


germ cells undergo meiosis to produce haploid cells
- produces 4 haploid cells


genetic inheritance
- gregor mendel (1882-1884) - the idea of single hypothetical "characters" by which  parents transmit traits to their children
- genotype: a set of particular alleles a child inherits
- phenotype: observable characteristics - a product of genes and environment
- allele - specific form of a gene
- dominant & recessive
	- dominant:  expressed
	- recessive: not expressed
- homozygous & heterozygous
	- homozygous: alleles are the same
	- heterozygous: alleles are different


when a person is heterozygous for the trai, there are 3 possibilities
- characteristics of only one of the two alleles are expressed (e.g. cleft chin)
- characteristics intermediate between the two alleles are expressed (e.g. skin color)
- characteristics of both alleles are expressed (e.g. blood type)

e.g. blood types
- 4 types: A, B, AB, O
- 3 alleles: A, B, O
- O - recessive
- A,B - dominant (codominance)

type A: surface of red blood cells have only A surface molecules
	- has only B plasma antibodies

type B: surface of red blood cells have only B surface molecules
	- has only A plasma antibodies

type AB: surface of red blood cells have A and B surface molecules
	- has no plasma antibodies

type O: surface of red blood cells have no surface molecules
	- has both A and B plasma antibodies

mother: AB
	- alleles: A, B
father: AB
	- alleles: A, B

possible baby blood types:
- A IFF mother and father pass on A alleles
- B IFF mother and father pass on B alleles
- AB if mother passes A and father passes B OR mother passes B and father passes A


mother: A
	- alleles: A, O
father: B
	- alleles: B, O
possible baby blood types
- A IFF mother passes A and father passes O
- AB IFF mother passes A and father passes B
- B IFF mother passes O and father passes B
- O IFF both mother and father pass O alleles

why is this a simple example
- discrete trais: either-or (have or don't have)
- (missed in slides)



genetic influences on brain structure

sex linked effects: X and Y chromosomes

genetic transmission of sex (X,Y)
- parents donate X or Y but XX and XY not 50/50 at conception
- conception: 120M:100F
- Birth: 106M:100F
- 18 y: 100M:100F
- 50 y: 95M:100F
- 67 y: 70M:100F
- 87 y: 50M:100F
- 100y: 21M:100F
