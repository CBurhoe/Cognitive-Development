Ubiquity of gene-environment interaction in development: reaction range vs norm of reaction
- norm of reaction model explains the data (from last lecture); range of reaction which stipulates relativey rigid ranges or boundaries caused by genes, falsified
- gene-envrionment coaction
- bidirectional interactions between gene and environement lead to more complex models in deevelopment


gene-environment interaction
- dias & ressler, 2013
	- trained mice to become afraid of an odor
	- females were trained prior to becoming pregnant
	- measured how much an animal is strtled by a loud noise
- findings:
	- naive adult offspring also startled more in response to the odor one parent learned to fear
	- were not more anxious in general
	- were more able to detect the odor
	- next generation also showed this heightened sensitivity to the odor
	- both mothers and fathers passed the trait
	- sensitized mothers didn't pass it to fostered pups
	- both the parent and offspring had more space in olfactory bulb dedicated to that odor
	- epigenetic alteration

- skinner et al.
	- reported that injecting pregnant rats with a common pesticide cause sperm abnormalities that persisted for at least 4 generations


gene-environment interactions: drugs and alcohol

fetal alcohol syndrome
- nicloux (1899): alcohol crosses placenta and shown in fetus of guinea pig, dog, at concentrations close to mother's
- lemoine et al., (1968): 127 offspring from 29 french families with chronic alcoholism. 
	- malformations of palate, eyes, limbs, heart, etc. characteristic facial profile, delayed motor/language, mean IQ = 70 (really low)
- recent studeis confirm cognitive effects on infants

effects of alcohol (table from Driscoll, Streissguth, & Riley, 1990)

streissguth et al., 1999
- findings from seattle longitudinal prospective study (started in 1974); 
- low risk population studied before general awareness of alcohol effects on pregnancy outcomes
- subjects: women enrolled in prenatal care by 5th month of pregnancy
- screening: low-risk lifestyle (health, alcohol, caffeine, etc)
- follow-up cohort: 500 infants from original sample and others from mothers of different drinking patterns(?)

independent var: frequency of drinking during and prior to pregnancy
dependent vars: physical, psychological, and neurobehavioral measures
- exams on day 1-2 of life, 8, 18 months, 4, 7, 14 years
- teacher evaluations at 8 and 11 years
- exams conducted blind to exposure history
- confounds considered and ruled out: maternal nutrition, use of drugs, etc.

results: 
- effects are dose dependent without a threshold
- three types of outcomes: neurobehavioral, growth, & physical anomalies
- birth: all 3 related to prenatal alcohol exposure
- 8 months: physical and neurobehavioral deficits
- 4 and 7 years: physical and neurobehavioral deficits 
- 14 years: no facial dysmorphic features, still show effects of neurobehavioral deficits

measures and results
- day 1: brazelton neonatal scale. abnormal results in habituation, response modulation, latency to suck, lower sucking pressure
- 8 months: bayley scales. alcohol use related to decrements in mental and motor development
- 4 years: decreased attention and longer reaction times on computerized "vigilance" test, longer latency to correct, poorer fine and gross motor performance
- 7 years: decrements on WISC (arithmetic and digit span subtests), deficits in vigilance, poorer spatial memory, etc.
- 14 years: poorer performance on attention, memory, language, arithmetic, etc

brain: smaller; less convolution -> less surface area, fewer neurons

how can we study the role of genes in cognition?
- studies of heritability: degree to which variaiton in a characteristic in an individual (...)

genetic detection
- genetic screening of parents
- chorionic villi sampling
- amniocentesis


trisomies: chromosomal abnormalities
- trisomy 18: edward's syndrome
- trisomy 13: patau's syndrome
- trisomy 21: down's syndrome
	- 1 in 1000
	- occurrence related to mother's age
		- up to age 30: less than 1 in 800
		- 40: 1 in 100
		- 45: 1 in 32
		- 49: 1 in 12

trisomy 21: down's syndrome
- facial characteristics
- crease across palm
- protruding palm
- heart, eye, ear problems
- moderate "overall" intellectual disability
- language worse than expected for mental age
- symptoms range from quite mild to quite severe


phenylketonuria (PKU)
- caused by defective recessive gene
- 1 in 10,000-15,000 live births in US
- reduces body's ability to convert phenylalanine into tyrosine (two amino acids)
- results in accumulation of phenylalanine, which retards development of neurons of brain, primarily in pre-frontal cortex
- can be tested prenatally, most newborns are tested
- problems with "executive funtions", e.g. cognitive inhibition (A. Diamond)
