object permanence

what do errors mean?

piaget: lack of object permanence in infants

cog neuroscience view: immature working memory, frontal cortex. errors in A not B depend on length
  of time between observing oject disappear and search (A. Diamond)

cascading developmental effects view: repeated training at one location pulls vis attention/motoric responses into entraining effect
  responses will continue even in absence of target(...)


object permanence in 3.5 and 4.5 month olds (Baillargeon, 1987)
- 3.5 and 4.5 month old infants
experiment 1: 
  - 4.5 month olds
  - measuring looking time
  - screen rotating back and forth 180-degrees
  - habituation trials, then control or experimental condition
    - box or no box, possible or impossible events
  - look longer at impossible events
experiment 2:
  - 3.5 month olds
  - at first, no significant differesne between possible and impossible
  - then divided into fast and slow habituators
    - fast habituators: look longer at impossible vs possible event
    - slow habituators: no difference in looking time between possible and impossible events

results:
  - infants mentally represent object when they go out of view
  - there's more...
  - deformability changes with material (rigid/non-rigid): 7.5 month olds are ables to reason about occlusions of soft objects
    vs rigid objects
  - objects occupy a particular sized space: 6.5 month olds detect an 80% violation (intrusion) into the objects space
  - (...)

innate knowledge and learning in event categories (Baillargeon, 2004)
- infants have innate knowledge of general principles of objects and events
- continuity: objects exist continuously in time and space
- solidity: two objects cannot exist at the same time in the same space


violations detected by 2.5 month olds:
- occlusion
- containment
- covering

innate knowledge and learning in event categories
- however they must learn about the specific properties of individual objects and how those properties interact with specific event types
  - height of objects: understood earlier in occlusion than containment events (4.5 vs 7.5 months)
  - height of objects: earlier in containment than in covering (9 vs 12 months)
  - transparency: understood earlier in occlusion than containment events (7.5 vs 10 months)
- although 4.5 month olds detect height violations in occlusion events, they do not do so until 7.5 months for containment events
- although 9 month olds detect height violations in containment events, they do not do so until 10 months for covering events
- although 7.5 month olds detect violations of transparency in occlusion events, they do not do so in containment until 10 months

predictions:
- infants who have not yet identified a variable as relevant should fail to detect changes involving the variable (e.g. not notice height change in covering event
  if have not yet identified it as relevant)
- infants should be trainable: if show contrastive events in which variable X (e.g. height) is relevant (e.g. covering), then infant should learn
  that height is relevant and now detect violations




numbers

piaget on number in children
- when a 5 yo sees a quantity of liquid poured into a new container that alters its immediate perceptual qualities, the child reports that the amount has changed

conservations
- for piaget the mature concept of number/quantity brings with it the understanding that certain transformations are irrelevant, while others are relevant
- this same interpretation holds whether we are dealing with continuous quantities (fluids) or discontinuous quantities (objects)
- if piagets interpretation is correct, then we should not be able to "train" conservations
  - and indeed many experiments have tried and failed
- but Michelle Gelman provided counterevidence

gelman, 1969
- task: odd man out
  - pick which row of dots/line does not match the others
- gelman: young children fail to conserve because of inattention to relevant quantitative relationships and attention to irrelevant features in classical conservation tests
- evidence: after training, posttests of conservation showed near perfect specific (length and number) and ~60% nonspecific (mass and liquid amount) transfer of training
- training effect persisted for at least 2-3 weeks
- so far, evidence shows tha tnumber is a part of the childs conceptual repertoire
- i.e. children can solve problems that involve numerical inequalities


magic show experiments (gelman, 1972)
- train which is winner, loser
- make changes to winner
- study reactions to unexpected subtractions and additions vs displacements
- measure looking times
  - if experimenter removed a mouse from winner plate but left length of row constant, children surprised
  - if experimenter changed the length of the row of mice, children not surprised, assumed 3 mice plate still winner
  - children realize that changing spatial arrangement of objects does not change their number
  - children know what transformations are relevant
    - for number, adding or subtracting, not rearranging

infant number discrimination
- e.g. 2 vs 3 in habituation studies
  - for visual displays
  - sequence of sounds
  - sequences of actions

wynn's jumping studies
- infants are habituated to a puppet jumping 2 or 3 times, then tested with 2 vs 3 jumps
- they dishabituated to the new number of jumps

wynn, 1992
- 5 month olds
- habituation
- longer looking times in unexpected cases
- if infants are responding to 1+1 by simply looking at the array with more or less, then they might not anticipate exactly 2
- but in fact they look longer to a display of 3 when the correct outcome is 2
- so even infants are able to represent number, and respond to discrepancies between expected and actual numbers as objects are added to or subtracted from arrays
- then why do 5 y/o fail conservation task
  - pragmatics?
  - task puzzles undergraduates...
