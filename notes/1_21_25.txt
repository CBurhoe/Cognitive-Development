Lecture 1: Cognitive Development

adults are different from embryos
how does this transformation happen?

theoretical issues
- sources of development
  - nature vs nurture
    - nature: genetic, innate from conception
    - nurture: environmental factors, developed as a result of external factors
  - mechanism
    - continuity vs discontinuity
      - discontinuity: discrete stages, drastic change in distinct steps
      - continuity: non-discrete stages, continuous, gradual
  - learning and plasticity
    - how?
  - species specificity
    - specific to a species, or general, or confined to a subset of species
  - individual differences
    - within species differences that bias an individual or subset of individuals to develop different cognitive functions
    - why?


origins of the discipline
- before 19th century
  - preformationism: children are small adults
  - children are the same as adults, just smaller and newer
- descartes 17th century - rationalism
  - innate potential (nature)
  - biological preparation
- locke 17th century - impericism
  - tabula rasa (blank slate)
  - role of environment (nurture, experience)
  - opposite of descarte's model

first studies
- natural study - Victor, the wild boy of Aveyron (itard, 1801)
  - nature or nurture?
  - found in the woods
  - couldn't speak, acted like a wild animal
  - after being introduced to society under itard
    - never learned to speak
  - nature vs nurture models depend on underlying function
    - communication, in particular language, depends more on nurture
    - survival depends more on nature
    - notion of a critical period
