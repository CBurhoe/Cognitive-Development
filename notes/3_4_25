shape discrimination
- during first weeks of life, infants prefer patterned to plain stimuli
- faces appear to be particularly interesting
- based on fixation time duration (greater = more interest)
- Fantz's original looking chamber designed to test

more shape discrimination
- infants appear to prefer complex stimuli to simpler stimuli
- especially prefer facelike forms, relative to simple non-facelike forms
- why? explanations range from strong nativist theories to those with a strong learning component

size constancy
- proximal and distal stimuli project differently on retina
- look different sizes
- in reality, same size objects
- size constancy: perception of an object or quality as constant even though our sensation of the object changes

size constancy at birth (slater et al., 1990)
- does stimulus size and/or viewing distance affect infants' looking time?

experiment 1:
- two high contrast stimuli (blocks): white cubes with black edging
	- small= 5.1 cm sides
	- large = 10.2 cm sides
- method:
	- eight pairings of size/distance of cubes presented to infants (max 3 per subject)
	- each pairing shown for two trials, until 20 seconds
- results: babies look longest at the stimulus which gives the largest retinal image
	- but no immediate implications for size constancy
experiment 2: do infants perceive REAL size of an object independently of its retinal size
- method: 6 newborns familiarized to small cube, 6- to large cube
- small cube familiarized at
	- 23, 53, 38, 69, 46, 61 cm
- large cube at same distances, different ordering
- familiarization trials: until accumulated 150 seconds LT
- test: two trials, with size/distance combination -> same retinal image
- small cube at 30.5cm dist
- large cube at 61cm dist
- results: preference for novel OBJECT
	- babies perceive the real size of the object

intermodal perception
is there a connection between what the baby sees and what he/she hears?
- the infant (4 months) looks at the animal that bounces in time with the sound (spelke, 1981)

is there a conneciton between what baby sees and what baby feels?
- infant recognizes the object they felt


- four weeks old babies suck on one of the pacifiers (smooth vs bumpy) while they are shown the pictures (meltzoff & borton, 1979)
- they tend to look at the image corresponding to what they have in their mouth
- intermodal coordination is most likely innate


imitation


rational imitation by 1 year
- infants imitate by one year- it is rational and interpretive, not simply a reenactment (gergely, bekkering, & kiraly, 2002)
- turning the light after watching an adult turn on the light with her head (while her hands are occupied or free)
	- when experimenter's hands are occupied, infants use hands 80% of the time
	- when experimenter's hands are free, infants use their head 75% of the time
	- demonstrates reasoning about the appropriate actions given a situation (need to turn on light vs need to use forehead to turn on light)

imitation of different agents
- do babies feel complled to imitate non-human agents (robots)
- sommer et al., 2021
- 230 1-3 year olds
- observing
	- human
	- video of human
	- video of humanoid robot
- assembling and using a homemade rattle
- assembling a dowel to use for turning on a light
results
- rattle imitation
	- less likely to imitate robot
	- less likely to imitate human on screen (not always significant difference)
- light imitation
	- much less likely to imitate robot (almost no imitation of robot)
	- huge difference between human and human on screen in 2 year olds, not for 1 or 3 year olds
- human > robot
- live human >= human on screen
- agent x agent interaction


do newborns imitate? what would it mean?

infant imitation (meltzoff & moore, 1997)
experiment 1
- n = 6, 12-17 days old
- each gesture demonstrated 4 times in 15 sec period for each of 4 gestures, randomly presented; blank facial expressions
- immediately followed by 20 sec response period (E is passive)
- independently coded by judges who are observing infant and ranking which behavior they are demonstrating (without seeing experimenters)
results: babies reliably imitated experimenters
experiment 2
- n = 12, 16-21 days old
- includes pacifier during exposure
same results: babies reliably imitated experimenters

possible mechanisms (meltzoff)
- parental or experimenter reinforcement?
- innate releasing mechanism (IRM)
- neonate's capacity to represent visual and proprioceptive perceived information in a form common to both modalities. an active process of matching

IRM
- these are innate, special, pre-packaged actions, triggered, by particular stimuli
- highly tied to biology
- matching should occur for just a few evolutionarily privileged gestures
- for of the response should be fixed an stereotypic
- matching should be time-locked to triggering display

meltzoff's proposal: active intermodal mapping, not innate releasing mechanism
- active intermodal mapping (AIM)
- infant imitation
- newborns
- range of acts
- novel acts
- absent targets

room for debate: jones's work
- infant's imitation of tongue protruding reflects a coincidental match between a sight that infants find interesting and a behavior by which infants express interest (jones, 1996)
- in reality we know little to nothing about the mechanisms underlying newborn imitation, which are likely discontinuous with later imitation (jones, 2007)
- jones argues that imitation undergoes lengthy development during infancy
- mimicry: reproducing another's specific muscle movements
- emulation: reproducing the effects of another person's actions, usually by deferred imitation
- jones' study (2007): 8 behaviors produced by parents, 4 sounds, 4 non-sounds. 162 infants ranging from 6-20 months
