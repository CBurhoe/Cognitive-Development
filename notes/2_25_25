spatial cognition
- skill in representing transforming, generating, etc


sample task
- spatiotemporal abilities
	- moving ball goes into obscured region, press button when ball expected to appear on other side
- etc


methodologies (halpern, 2000)
- animal models
- heritability studies
- abnormal cases of human development

heritability studies: sex linked recessive gene theory of spatial ability
- considers entire pool of individuals
- assumes high spatial ability is a sex-linked recessive trait carries on X chromosome
- predicts
	- F gets 2 X, so if one doesn't carry high spatial ability, don't show in phenotype
	- M gets 1 X from mother, so if X carries high spatial ability, nothing to dominate it so phenotype will show high spatial ability
	- trait for high spatial ability should show up more frequently in males than females (on average)

spatial ability: arguing from abnormal cases
- Turner's syndrome (45XO): X-linked recessive gene theory predicts that Turner's syndrome individuals should show M pattern of spatial superiority, relative to verbal
	- false, Turner's syndrome people are quite poor spatially
- several cases of 46XX genotype but phenotypically male genetiacally should show F pattern of spatial 
	- false?

spatial ability: evolutionary theory
Newcombe (2007):
- man the hunter
	- men with better spatial abilities more likely to survive while hunting (catch food, find home, etc), selectively chosen
- man who gets around
	- procreation requires navigating around fertile females
	- meadow voles vs prairy voles
- if it's linked to hormones in humans- M spatial ability an accident?

Geary (2021):
- male-male competition
	- better spatial ability -> competitively better than other males, higher rate of lineage survival

effects of perinatal variation in hormonal environment
- also possibly linked to degree to which sex-linked behaviors expressed in adults
- experiments
	- fetus exposed to var amounts of estrogen/testosterone by siblings in utero (von Saal, with rodents)
	- female fetal mice lying between 2 male fetuses have higher concentration of T in blood and amniotic fluid than Fs developing between 1 male and 1 female or between 2 females
	- if develop between 2 males, Fs reproduce fine but
		- have erratic cycles
		- mate later
		- stop bearing young earlier

having a male co-twin masculinizes mental rotation performance in females
Vuoksimaa et al., 2010
- 351 females from same sex pairs
- 223 males from same sex pairs
- 120 females from opposite sex pairs
- 110 males from opposite sex pairs
- tested on mental rotation task
results
- significant difference for females
	- opposite sex female twin performs better than same sex females twins
- non-significant difference for males

question: hormones or socialization with twin brother (or both)?

role of hormones in performance on mental rotation 
(durdivakova et al., 2013)
- 147 boys 10-18 years, IQ > 130
- CAG polymorphism in androgen receptor genes were associated with better performance on mental rotation
- suggests genetic basis

(constantinescu et al., 2018)
- 61 healthy infants
- salivary T at 1-2.5 months and 5-6 months
- mental rotation task at 5-6 months
	- habituation, time looking at matching toy vs non-matching toy
- T higher in boys, boys perform better on MRT
- suggests organizational effects of early postnatal T surge
- also check parental attitudes towards gender at 5-6 months
- negative correlation between parents' gender-stereotypical attitudes and mental rotation only in girls (not in boys)
- suggests influence of social factors and environment

(moe et al., 2018)
- 176 italian and german freshmen in college
- stem or no stem degree
- MRT, motivation, practice with spatial sports, childhood spatial toys and sports preference questionnaires
- women in stem degrees preferred spatial toys more than women in non-stem
- women in stem performed better on mental rotation if they also preferred spatial toys in childhood
- suggests influence of experience in childhood and adulthood

role of the experience:
levine et al., 2005
- initial observations
	- males outperform females on spatial tasks, esp mental rotation
	- true in african, asian, and western cultures
	- but not in eastern canadian eskimos
	- in iceland, females superior on certain math tests
276 by=oys and 271 girls in chicago, assessed in fall and spring of 2nd and 3rd grade
- SES was tracked (low, middle, high by income)
- four testing sessions over 2 years with three tasks
	- aerial maps: select map locaiton of 4 choices corresponding to place marked by a star on photo
	- mental rotation
	- syntax comprehension task
- effects of testing session - improvement over time
- effects of SES for each task - high and middle SES > low SES
- sex effects for two spatial tasks- M>F (but not for language)
- sex x SES interaction for two spatial tasks but not language task
- male advantage on two spatial tasks but not language task for middle and high SES but not low SES
explanations for difference in male spatial advantage over SES
- is advantage due solely to most difficult items? (if low SES children never made it to these items, no diff would emerge). but no correlation between item difficulty and male advantage in any group
- diff levels of engagement in spatial activities, both across ses (...)

Rahe et al., 2021
- effect of testing material?
- exp 1: 89 F, 45 M
- M > F
- no effect of testing material (block rotations)

- exp 2: 110 F, 79 M
- M > F on tractor rotations
- F = M on stroller rotation
- effect of testing material
- role of experience?

is mathematical performance susceptible to environmental changes? (hyde et al., 2008)
- meta analytic data from 1990
- gender diff in math performance in overall population were trivial (d=-0.05) but more significant in complex problem solving in high school (d = +)
- since then
	- girls take more advanced math and science in HS
	- by 2000 (...)
- data form 10 states testing of all students in each grade
- total = 7 million students
- effect sizes uniformly <.01

- greater male variance doesn't translate into large gender differences at upper end of tail (high achieving students, 95th and 99th percentiles)
- NB: is a given specialty required math at 99th percentile, and the gender raito was 2.0, expectaion is 67% M:33% F but engineering PhD programs in 2008 average only 15% F
	- 2015: ~25% F

empathizing-systemizing theory of sex differences (baron-cohen, 2002)
- continuum of how we relate to the world
	- categorizing things
	- relating to people
- usual cognitive domains for sex differences: verbal/spatial
- here, a neglected dimension for defining male vs female brains: degree to which a person is
	- systemising: drive to analyze variables in a system, derive the underlying rules that govern behavior of the system. drive to construct systems and contorl it
	- empathizing: ability to recognize a persons mental state and relate to it

kinds of systems we can organize
- techical systems
- natural systems
- abstract systems
- social systems
- organizable systems
- motor systems

E-S theory of sex differences
- 2 dimensional grid
	- systemising on X axis
	- empathizing on Y axis
	- types
		- B: E = S ("balanced brain")
		- E: E > S ("female brain")
		- S: E < S ("male brain")
		- Extreme type E ("extreme female brain")
		- Extreme type S ("extreme male brain")

evidence for the empathizing brain (baron-cohen, 2002)
- "sex diff of a small but statistically significant magnitude have been found"
- high degrees of sharing and turn taking
- low degrees of rough and tumble play
- empathic responding to distress of others
- using a "theory of mind"
	- being able to understand that other individuals have their own mental state
- sensitivity to facial expressions
- low incidence of psychopathic personality disorder
- low degrees of aggression
- low degrees of murder

evidence for systemising brain
- strength in rule governed activities (chess, football, not faces or conversations)
- preference for weapons, building blocks, mechanical toys
- pref for metalworking, weapon making, construction
- strength in math, physics, and engineering
- high constructional ability (3D apparatus, e.g.)
- strength in water level task
- field independence in the rod and frame test
- strong map reading
- strong attention to relevant detail (embedded figures task, e.g.)
