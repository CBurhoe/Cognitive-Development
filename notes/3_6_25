jones (2007)
- 8 behaviors produced by parents
  - 4 sounds
  - 4 non-sounds
  - 162 infants age 6-20 months
  - parents model for up to 3 minutesm infants respond

background:
- longitudinal study on Yo: no matching at all at 3 months, but mother mimicked Yo a lot. 6-12 months, first behavioral matches, but only those that Yo had
  independently produced on her own, parent had imitated, were accompanied by sound
- Q: when do infants begin to match other's behaviors? what kind of behaviors first matched?

jones:
- sounds and visible actions among earliest imitated
- no imitation until 8 months

putting together with action
- classical studies of the visual cliff... what we now know about crawling (...)

perception and action
- classical studies by e.j. gibson showed that depth perception could guide action by 9 months of age: infants like the young of other mobile species
  stopped at the edge of a cliff (covered by plexiglass)
- why?
- matturational view
  - innate visuo-motor program that is triggered at the right time in development
  - predictions: 
    - universal appearance of the program "on time" and for every individual infant, accompanied by "fear" response
      - test: do all infants stop at the cliff at the right age?
    - little role of specific experience, per se
      - test: studies by campos et al.
    - generalization across motor systems such as reaching or crawling, etc
      - test: studies by karen adolph

early experience and emotional development: the emergence of wariness of heights (campos et al., 1992)
- how are wariness (avoidance) and depth perception related?
- early theory: depth perception engages emotional reaction of avoidance; this is a maturational effect (e.j. gibson)
- studies on precocial species (mature and mobile at birth)

- an alternative (later) theory: learning plays a large role. infant's perception of depth precedes wariness. avoidance of cliffs learned through experience (campos et al.)
- consistent with probabilistic epigenesis (gottlieb) where new experiences engender conditions for development- and these lead to new neurophysiological structures

- held and hein (1963)
  - dark reared kittens given active self-produced locootion experience in lighted environment avoid heights
  - dark reared littermates given passive experience in the same environment show no avoidance

depth perception, action, and learning (campos et al.)
- select an ecologically valid paradigm: visual cliff
- use multiple outcome measures
  - wariness reaction when lowered to deep/shallow side
    - facial expression
    - HR responses during 3s period of descent onto cliff surface. HR decelerates for infants in state of non-fearful attentiveness; 
      accelerates for infants showing defensive of pre-cry state
  - visual "placing" response- index of depth perception (placing towards shallow, not deep side)

experiment 1: locomoting vs non-locomoting infants (age held constant)
- 92 infants
  - 1/2 locomoting for 5 weeks
  - all tested at 7.3 months
- measured 
  - HR
  - facial expression
  - visual placing
- (...)
results
- locomoting infants show increased HR from base level on deep trials only
- prelocomoting infants do not show difference between base level compared to either deep or shallow trials
- no findings for facial expression
- all infants show visual placing on shallow side, none show it on the deep side
  - demonstrates that depth perception is independent of locomotion experience
=> depth perception for all, fear only for locomoting infants

experiment 2: accelerating locomotion experience
- give infants walkers to use at home (place in, wheels to provide stability)
- test after 32 hours of voluntary forward movement in walker at home
- experimental group: infants given walkers
  - 1/2 prelocomotor
  - 1/2 locomoting roughly 5 days
  - all roughly 6-7 months of age
- control: same composition, not given walkers
- test: deep trials only
results
- infants with locomoting experience of any kind - cardiac acceleration
- (...)
- also differences between
  - all infants using walkers vs controls
  - spontaneously locomoting infants vs pre-locomoting controls
  - prelocomoting infants with walkers vs controls 

experiment 3: deprivation of locomotion
- infant with hip displaysia in cast until 8.5 months; then removed, and infants started to crawl
- tested on visual cliff monthly between 6-10 months
- started HR acceleration for deep side (and deceleration on shallow) at 10 months
- no signs of differentiation for side before this age
- conclusion: crawling experience may have induced wariness reactions

experiment 4: age of locomotion onset vs experience
- measure: crossing deep vs shallow side (from center)
- vars:
  - age of onset
  - duration of locomoting experience (# days)
results
- effect of experience regardless of age of onset
- as locomotion experience increases, more infants avoid descending onto deep side, and take longer to descend from center bard onto deep side
- beginning crawlers (after 11 days of experience): 30-50% avoid deep side
- experienced crawlers (after 41 days): 60-80% avoid deep side

effects of learning to crawl
- experience counts. moving around the world changes one's predictions about what actions will produce what effects
- (...)
- campos et al.
  - experience -> fear of heights -> avoidance
  - reflects understanding of what kinds of ground properties needed ot support body
  - experiential, general learning - once you've learned about the correlation (...)
- infants with little/no crawling experience show no wariness of heights
- adults have strong wariness of heights
- depth perception nor falling experience (...)
- (...)


alternative: sway model (karen adolph)
- falling is due to insufficient muscle strength needed to pull oneself back into position
- this varies with surface properties and with aciton- sit, crawl, walk posture have different regions of "permissible sway"
- infant must adjust to avoid moving towards outer limits- need to gauge own muscle torque to avoid sway
- proposal: this is organized within each postural system: learning is posture specific
- possible evidence: test generalization of knowledge that the body cannot be supported in an empty space. if fear of heights is derived from this
  general knowledge about body support, then (...)

variation across motor systems: adolph's experiments
- 9 month olds tested in experienced sitting posture and less familiar crawling posture within same session
- with increasing gap distance between baby and stick
  - sit and reach for toy at end of stick
  - crawl to reach for toy on platform
- psychophysical staircase
