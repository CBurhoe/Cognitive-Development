PKU - Phenylketonuria
- metabolic disease leading to accumulation of phenylalanine, an essential amino acid
- usually converted to tyrosine by phenylalanine hydroxylase
- gene located on chromosome 12
- PKU is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder
- elevated phenylalanine and reduced tyrosine
- tyrosine needed for dopamine and norepinephrine
- phenylalanine uses same transporters to get across blood brain barrier
- routine newborn screening
	- heel stick
	- test for high phenylalanine and low tyrosine
	- if positive, use another method to verify
- first-line therapy includes low PHE diet
- pharma treatment
	- kuvan
	- cofactor for phenylalanine hydroxylase
	- improve inate path enzyme activity
	- increase phenylalanine tolerance

PKU 
- remediation: diet low in phenylalanine (limit milk, eggs, bread, fish); reduces negative effects on brain function
- critical period: remediation must takes place by 3 months of age, otherwise permanent damage to the brain

william's syndrome (researched at JHU)
genetic defect:
- microdeletion ~26 genes on long arm of chromosome 7
phenotypic characteristics:
- facial morphology (elf-ish)
- defects of organs, especially heart
- mild to moderate intellectual disability
- delay of development of motor skills
- low muscle tone
- tend to be extremely socially engaging/outgoing
- hypersensitivity to auditory stimuli
interesting features
- usually intellectual disability manifests itself strongly in language
	- not seen in william's syndrome; language is completely unaffected
- unusual cognitive profile
	- when shown a circle with the top half blue and bottom half red
		- correctly report the orientation of the colored halves
		- when asked to copy, draw a blue blob on left, a red vertical line, and a red blob on the right

language and space as modular systems
- contrast between visuo-spatial and language abilities in williams syndrome
	- drawn image of elephant is nonsensical
	- spoken description of an elephant is eloquent and verbose, very detailed and precise, and makes sense
- evidence supporting that visuo-spatial and language cognitive systems are modular, distinct

how do genes influence cognition
- missing genes -> brain -> cognitive structure -> behavior

williams syndrome
- selective strength
	- objects (representation of object kind)
	- motion perception (bio motion, motion coherence)
	- spatial language (motion events)
- severe impairment
	- vision-for-action (dorsal visual pathway)
	- multiple object tracking (sustained attentional tracking)
	- praxis (drawing)

(look into williams syndrome and spatial language/sign language)

cognitive genetics: big questions and challenges
- selectivity: can there be selective deficits in certain cognitive functions with sparing in others and what would this mean?
- static vs developmental approaches: can we study genetic syndromes like we study brain damage in adults?
- developmental relationships: can we study one system independently form other systems?
- levels of analysis: how do we relate molecular changes produced by genes to higher level cognitive effects?


discussion: the dawn of cognitive genetics (G. Scerif & A. Karmiloff-Smith)
- observe:
	- decreased/absent expression of gene A
	- deficit in cognitive function B
- is it safe to assume:
	- gene A
	|
	V
	- cognitive function B


sexual differentiation

bases of gender
- genes: 46XX or 46XY
	- 46, with last pair being XX or XY
- hormones: estrogen, testosterone, etc.
	- gonads: ovaries, testes
- anatomy: internal and external sex organs
- (missed this)

development
- conception: XX or XY
	- for 7 weeks, no differentiation
- 7 weeks: if maleness gene (SRY - Sex-determining Region of Y) is present, 
	it becomes active, starts virilization (male development; gonadal ridges start to form testes).
	if not... (regardless of XX or XY; could be XY with malfunctioning SRY or receptors)
- 12 weeks: development of ovaries
- last 6 months of prenatal development: presence of T (testosterone) suppresses natural rhythmic activity in brain
- Female is the default case
- presence or absence of testosterone determines morphology and behavior
- 5 week critical period from 7-12wks for development of gonads

organizational and activational effects
- organizational effects: prenatal and perinatal hormones directing physical development (structure)
- activational effects: hormonal effects later in life affecting function
- but: hormones secreted in adulthood both activate existing neural circuits and may change morphology
	- medial amygdala usually larger in M adult rats than F adults. circulating T in M or F adults can change the size
	- adult birds/mammals produce new neruons in specific brain regions throughout life; gonadal hormones can modulate life span of new cells

role of hormones in dimorphic organization of M/F patterns
- established very early in development; within critical period ("organizational effects" - permanent)
- basic experiments: masulinized females; feminized males (Levine and others)
