Last time
- critical period for developing face perception demonstrated by Sugita, 2008 in monkeys
- faces not special for newborns demonstrated by turati, 2004


or are they? (heering & rossion, 2015)
- eeg of 15 4-6 month olds looking at faces and objects presented 6 per second (OOOOFOOOOFOO...)
- or scrambled faces and objects with same contrast and colors
results
- bilateral occipital response at 6 hz (for every image)
- right occipito-temporal response at 1.2 hz (face image frequency)
- near fusiform face area (FFA)
- no R occipito-temporal response for scrambled images
- adult-like brain specialization for faces already present at 4-6 months
- faces are special



knowledge of the world
- how does it happen
- what is it like
- when does it come about


preliminary observations
- infants act as if objects cease to exist
- 4 year olds cannot tell when 2 quantities are the same
- children cannot understand the contents of another person's mind

jean piaget
- theorist on a grand scale- cog dev of children goes through specific stages, across all areas of interest
  - objects
  - space
  - number
  - time
  - geometry

piaget's stages of cognitive development
1. 0-2 years
  - sensorimotor
  - explore world through senses and actions
  - develop object permanence, stranger anxiety
2. 2-7 years
  - preoperational
  - represent and refer to objects and events with words or images
  - use intuitive rather than logical reasoning
  - believe inanimate objects possess human feelings/emotions
  - develop pretend play, egocentrism
3. 7-11 years
  - concrete operational
  - conserve, reverse their thinking, and classify objects
  - think logically and understand analogies but only about concrete events
  - develop conservatism, mathematical transformations
4. 12+ years
  - formal operational
  - use abstract reasoning about hypothetical scenarios, consider logical possibilities, and systematically examine/test hypothesis
  - develop abstract logic, potential for mature moral reasoning


substages of sensorimotor stage
ss1
- 0 - 1 1/2 months
- reflex schemas exercised
- involuntary sucking, rooting, grasping, looking
ss2
- 1 1/2 - 4 months
- primary circular reactions
- repetition of actions that are pleasurable in themselves
ss3
- 4-8 months
- secondary circular reactions
- dawning awareness of the effects of ones own actions on the environment
ss4
- 8-12 months
- coordination of secondary circular reactions
- combining schemas to achieve a desired effect
- problem solving
ss5
- 12-18 months
- tertiary circular reactions
- deliberate variation of problem solving means
- experiment to see what consequences will be
ss6
- 18-24 months
- beginnings of symbolic representation
- images and words come to stand for familiar objects
- invention of new means of problem solving through symbolic combinations


piaget's theory
- knowledge as the focus
- schemas as mental units; these have internal structure (domain-independent)
- development of knowledge is like biological development: adaptive, under continuous development, but stage like
piaget's quetion
- does a child know that objects continue to exist when they are not part of our current perceptual world

object permanence
- when an infant sees an object and then it is hidden, he does not actively search for it until roughly 8 months of age

what do these errors mean
- piaget: children lack object permanence
- cognitive neuroscience: immature working memory, frontal cortex
  - errors in A not B depend on length of time between observing object disappear and search (A. diamond)
- cascading developmental effects: repeated training at one location pulls visual attention/motoric responses into entraining effect
  - responses will continue even in absence of target hidden object
  - responses will disappear if change infant's posture for new visual perspective (Smith and Thelen)

knowledge of objects in infancy: really a problem of existence?

baillargeon, 1987: object permanence in 3.5-4.5 month olds

infants mentally represent objects when they go out of view

theres more

deformability changes with material (rigid/non-rigid)L 7.5 month olds can reason about occlusion of soft objects (which can eb compressed)
vs rigid objects which cannot be compressed

objects occupy a particular sized space: 6.5 months olds detect an 80% violation (intrusion) into the objects space but not a 50% violation

objects can be moved via another object only if they are supported by them
