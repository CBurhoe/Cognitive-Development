Genetic transmission of sex (X,Y)

sex-linked genetic effects
e.g. red/green color blindness mostly observed in genetic males

- carried on the 23rd X chromosome, but show up in males
- M=6%, F=.9%
- X from dad in females could dominate X from mom
- Y from dad in males could NOT dominate X from mom
- homozygous recessive
- females get XX, hence normal X can dominate recessive X (color-blind gene)
- males are XY, hence nothing to dominate recessive color-blind X
- gene for color-blindness from mother who is probably NOT color blind, and this gene phenotypically appears in male offspring


gene environment interactions
- phenotypic plasticity: the degree of susceptibility of developing organism to influence by the environment
	- higher = more environmental effect
		e.g. height (maybe)
	- lower = less environmental effect
		e.g. eye color
- ensure that an individual is able to adapt to changes in the environment
- genes provide a blueprint and environment modulates the exact design
- basic principles:
	- range of reaction (cf. Gottlieb's "norm of reaction")
	- canalization

reaction range
e.g. himallayan rabbit fur
- all the possible gene-environmental relationships within an organisms life
- emphasizes variability
- assumption is that genes set the range and environment determines the specific outcome

waddington's landscape and canalization
- landscape varies over genes, environment, and developmental time
- canalized trait - not affected by changes in the environment or genotype
- canalization ensures that individuals are not thrown off by environmental or genetic variations

epigenetics
- control of gene expression by the environments encountered by the organism
- predetermined epigenesis: 
	- genetic activity leads to structure, which leads to function
	- structurees begin to function when they become mature

gottliebs probabilistic epigenesis (2007)
- problem:
	- studies of the genetic basis for psychopathology, e.g. do not show uniform, simple effects of genes "on" phenotype
	- scientists have been reluctant to move away from a "unidirectional, bottom-up approach"
- proposition
	- bidirectional influences
- contrasted with predetermined epigenesis which states that genetic activity leads to structure which leads to function
- neural structures function prio to maturityl this activity affects development, this is development
- 3 problems to confront for PE:
	- role of genes in developmental progress
	- implementing PE framework especially looking within and between levels of analysis
	- the concept of interaction


roles of genes in developmental process: not one-way
e.g. various reptiles
	- incubation temperature affects sex determination


implementing the PE framework
- 4 levels of analysis plus bidirectional influences
- PE model assumes that same genotype can have different neural and behavioral outcomes, depending on life experiences
- studies show it to be true (e.g. MAOA and violence)
- studies need ot include more than one form of gene and more than one kind of experience

ubiquity of gene-environment interaction in development: reaction range vs norm of reaction
- reaction range
	- holds constant the ordering across genotypes
- norm of reaction
	- observation in "usual" condition does not predict observations in deprived or enriched conditions
	- can't extrapolate genotype/phenotype observations across conditions
	- supported by observations in Hood (2005)

conclusion: norm of reaction model explains the data; range of reaction which stipulates relatively rigid "ranges" or boundaries caused by genes, falsified
- gene-environment "co-action" gotlieb
- for now: bidirectional interactions between genes and phenotype expression
