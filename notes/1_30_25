Last time:
- ended on germinal period for twins

Identical (monozygotic) twins
- subdivided into di/mono-chorionic and di/mono-amniotic, or fully conjoined

today:

fraternal (dizygotic) twins
- dizygotic = 2 zygotes
- 2 eggs released and fertilized by 2 sperm
- rate varies greatly by ethnicity
- genetic (from mother)
- ART, maternal age & size, prior pregnancies

embryonic period (after implantation)
- implantation to ~8 weeks
- placenta, chorion, amnion & fluid
- (picture in slide 7 is of prof Yarmolinskaya's fraternal twins)
- all major organs start to develop
	- ectoderm
		- nervous system
	- mesoderm
		- muscles
		- skeleton
	- endoderm
		- internal organs

week 2 - neural plate
week 3 - brain division, heart begins to beat
week 4 - limbs, eyes, ears, digestive sys, vertebrae, nerves begin developing, major veins and arteries - complete
week 5 - lungs, muscles, hands
week 7 - face stomach, thousands of brain cells per minute
week 8 - can move, responds to some stimulation


fetal period: 9 weeks post-conception to birth
- all basic tissues and organs already formed
- 1.5" -> 20"
- 0.02lbs -> 7lbs

fetal period: cognition
- starts moving around 8 weeks
- capable of all newborn's movements - 3-4 months
- around 5 months gestation: higher brain regions have begun to develop; able to sense mother's motion and reorients itself accordingly
- responds to sound - 5-6 months
- response to light - 6 months
- cerebral hemispheres and characteristic convolutions emerge in middle of pregnancy

in the normal case, newborn is a hearing, seeing, perceiving, and thinking being

next time: influences in prenatal development
